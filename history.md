In the summer of 2016, I realized it was more than coincidence that several people had told me I was the most productive person they knew. I also needed money. During a weekend retreat with [Ross Chanowski](https://twitter.com/Rchanowski/), I realized that I knew a thing or two about productivity, that I could share those things with people, and that people might pay me for that knowledge and hands-on support. Soon after that, I started with my first client (my dear friend, [Erin](http://www.eringh.com/)) and the rest is history.
