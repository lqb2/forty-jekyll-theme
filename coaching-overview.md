        <h2>Productivity Coaching</h2>
      </header>
      <p>Individual productivity coaching has helped people take a high-level view of their lives and start to make the changes they want to see. This happens by designing and running experiments to learn about yourself and then building systems that work for you based on that learning.</p>

<i>“What you taught me about projects versus tasks last week has totally changed the way I attend meetings! I think ‘Ohhhh the reason we’re not making any progress right now is because we’re only talking about big picture projects; We’re not getting down to the tasks and that would probably help us all actually move this whole thing forward.”</i>

        <h2>Personal Storytelling</h2>
      </header>
      <p>Our life stories and how we tell them are up to us. Deeply understanding our stories helps us situate ourselves in the world and remain grounded while pushing for change. Knowing, defining, and telling our personal stories is core to being about to do meaningful work. It is also important to know when to re-imagine and redefine our stories. We do this best with help from others and in community.</p>
      <p>I help people understand their stories and learn how to tell them strategically in order to be who they want to be in order to move the work they want to move in the world.</p>
