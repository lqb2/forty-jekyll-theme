Stories are how we understand the world. They shape our worldviews. They control what we pay attention to and what we don't. Why, then, do we pay so little attention our own stories? 

If we work together on your story, you'll get plenty of time to unpack and understand the elements of your story. This will include some digging into your heritage (pre-birth), a lot of digging into your story since birth, and some future visioning. Here's a little about the methodologies I use: 

| Past | Infinite growth, Gardening the community and diaspora mapping |
| Present | The Center for Story-Based Strategy, Restorative Narrative |
| Future | Evolutionary Leadership |
