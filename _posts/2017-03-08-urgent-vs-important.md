Fire is always important. But sometimes it becomes urgent. 

The fire in a woodfire stove is important to cook with, heat a room, etc. A uncontrolled forest fire is urgent. Being able to tell the difference is huge. 

Similarly, some of our work tasks are urgent, some are important, some are both, and some are neither. Learning how to identify and categorize tasks in this way isn't something that most of us learned intentionally or strategically. But if you do, your view on your life and work and relationships and more may change. 

In my opinion, being able to see the difference is like akin to being given the blue pill. Once you can see the Matrix, you can do things other people thought were impossible.
