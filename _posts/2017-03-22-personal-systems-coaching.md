The conversation about productivity is currently dominated by narratives about "work." But work is changing. The lines between "working" and not working are getting blurrier. 

Similarly, people have lots they want to do outside of the workplace. But talking about "being productive" doesn't quite feel right when talking about caring for a family, managing distant relationships, or maintaining a healthy list of leisure activities. 

The bad news is that there's no silver bullet when it comes to productivity. The good news is that there are so many different things to try that **something** is bound to work for everyone. 

If we work together on productivity coaching, over the course of three 1on1 sessions you'll:

* establish some goals,
* 
* learn what works for you, and
* learn how you learn. 

By the end of the sessions, you'll be prepared to continue building a personal system (with or without my support) that keeps gets better over time.
